"""
Mod installation pipeline: parallel downloads, sequential installs.
For each mod in build order: download (up to 3 at once) → extract → detect → install.

- Up to 3 mods download concurrently; extraction and install stay sequential so
  patchers never clobber each other.
- Multi-file submissions are downloaded and installed in order.
- TSLPatcher mods go through the strategy cascade (headless HoloPatcher shim →
  Win32 automation → pywinauto → manual GUI) so almost nothing needs a click.
- Install-phase progress is reported so the UI can show live status.
